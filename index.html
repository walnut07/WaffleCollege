                        <p>Since she was a kid, she had loved creating something by using a computer; she composed songs by playing real instruments and programming on music software. One time, even a professional musician described her song as “this song has a similar vibe to Matsutoya Yumi.”<br>
                            Though she loved composing songs with Tech, she thought STEM subjects were too difficult for her to major in. This is assumingly because almost all of her friends were going to major in Humanities as well.<br><br></p> 
                        <p>She decided to go to a women’s college to major in social welfare and gender studies which she had been curious about since she thought women were underrated in society.</p>
