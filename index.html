                        <p>Since she was a kid, she had loved creating something by using a computer; she composed songs by playing instruments and programming on music software. Even a professional musician described her song as “this song has a similar vibe to Matsutoya Yumi.”<br>
                            Though she loved composing songs with Tech, she thought STEM subjects were too difficult for her to major in. This is assumingly because almost all of her friends were going to major in Humanities or Social Science as well.<br><br></p> 
                        <p>She decided to go to women’s college to study social welfare and gender studies which she had been curious about since she thought women were excluded in society.</p>

                        <p>On the other hand, there was part of her who thought “I’d certainly regret my decision if I gave up here.” She denied to study STEM without reasonable reasons.
